Enhanced Celestials - Introduces moon rotation events for lethal company. This mod focuses on 4 main moon rotations for now, which is : {none ; blood moon ; diamond moon ; harvest moon}.

Blood Moon - Increases danger on moons by increasing the spawn rate of mobs by 2x.
Diamond Moon - Increases the value of scrap inside the facility by 1.5x-2.5x at random.
Harvest Moon - Adds an extra day for the deadline before you have to sell.

Note that the most common one is a normal moon, but any of these other 3 might occur between the time of 6pm and midnight. The mod might get updates to add more moons.
